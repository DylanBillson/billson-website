                <h3>Galea joins the family</h3>
                <p>In 2025, the flagship system formerly known as GRiST was re-imagined as Galea, becoming the first member in the Xperfecta family.</p>
                <p>Galea continues to evolve as the mental-health division of Xperfecta — a trusted tool for professionals, individuals and organisations alike, embodying our shared mission to make insight accessible, accountable, and human.</p>

                <h3>The foundation of Xperfecta</h3>
                <p>In 2024, Dr Buckingham founded Xperfecta as an umbrella organisation to extend these decision-support principles beyond mental health.</p>
                <p>The goal was clear: to build technologies that amplify human judgement across multiple sectors, always with transparency and empathy at their core.</p>

                <p>By 2022, the GRiST project became an independent company called Egrist, enabling the team to focus fully on embedding human intelligence into software.</p>
                <p>This period saw the formalisation of the decision-support platform that now underpins all Xperfecta products — combining research rigour with practical design for real-world use.</p>

                <h3>The GRiST Era</h3>
                <p>Fif’s model was first applied to the challenge of identifying suitable candidates for psychotherapy.These ideas then powered GRiST (Galatean Risk and Safety Technology), a digital system for capturing expert reasoning in mental-health assessment.</p>
                <p>Supported by grants from the UK Government, European Union, and health charities, GRiST demonstrated how structured reasoning could make professional expertise more consistent and explainable long before “AI” entered the mainstream.</p>

                <h3>Academic Origins</h3>
                <p>Xperfecta’s roots lie in the pioneering research of Dr Christopher (Fif) Buckingham, whose PhD work explored how humans make complex decisions.</p>
                <p>His Galatean model proposed that people judge new situations by comparing them to a perfect internal example, rather than a typical average.</p>
                <p>This breakthrough reshaped how experts think about reasoning, risk, and concern — and became the theoretical core for what would evolve into Xperfecta’s decision-support technologies.</p>
