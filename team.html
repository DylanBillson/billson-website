              <p>Machines process data but humans are responsible for decisions based on the results. With so much data and so many ways of analysing them, making sense of machine learning is non trivial. Dr Christopher (Fif) Buckingham's goal is to tackle the problem by building decision support systems that give coherent advice through linking mathematical analysis of large data sets with psychological processes that humans naturally use to understand their world.</p>
              <p>Buckingham is a cognitive scientist with qualifications in Psychology (Bsc) and Computer Science (MSc and PhD). During his PhD, he developed a psychological model of classification that became the engine of his decision support applications. All of them are driven by the aim of making artificial intelligence support intuitive human decision making. He tackles the paradox of simple explanations that are necessarily built on complex reality: unleashing the power of maths without the bamboozlement; decision support that is easy to understand without perverting their inherent truth.</p>
